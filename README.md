Dynamic Route Optimization and Emission Reduction System
This Python-based application optimizes vehicle routes in real-time using traffic, weather, and vehicle-specific data. It calculates the most efficient route and estimates CO2 emissions to help reduce environmental impact. The system integrates APIs like TomTom, Google Maps, AQICN, and OSRM for dynamic routing and emission reduction.

Features
Real-Time Route Optimization: Uses traffic and weather data to recommend the most efficient route.

Emission Estimation: Calculates CO2 emissions for each route based on vehicle details.

API Integration: Fetches data from TomTom, Google Maps, AQICN, and OSRM.

User-Friendly: Simple CLI interface for input and output.

Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher

API keys for:

TomTom API

Google Maps API

AQICN API

Install required Python libraries.

Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dynamic-route-optimization.git
cd dynamic-route-optimization
2. Set Up a Virtual Environment
Create and activate a virtual environment:

bash
Copy
# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
3. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python libraries:

bash
Copy
pip install requests numpy pandas
4. Add API Keys
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your API keys:

plaintext
Copy
TOMTOM_API_KEY=your_tomtom_api_key
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key
AQICN_API_KEY=your_aqicn_api_key
5. Run the Application
Execute the Python script:

bash
Copy
python main.py
Usage
Input Vehicle Details:

Provide vehicle details such as fuel type (gasoline, diesel, or electric) and fuel efficiency (km per liter or kWh).

Input Start and End Locations:

Enter the start and destination addresses.

View Results:

The system will output the optimal route and estimated CO2 emissions.

Example
python
Copy
# User Input
start_location = "New York, NY"
end_location = "Boston, MA"
vehicle_details = {
    "fuel_type": "gasoline",
    "fuel_efficiency": 12  # km per liter
}

# Optimize Route
optimal_route, emissions = optimize_route(start_location, end_location, vehicle_details)

# Output Results
print("Optimal Route:", optimal_route['summary'])
print("Estimated Emissions (kg CO2):", emissions)
